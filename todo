language_model: run experiments A,B,C and get 3 perplexity result files in correct format + model weights for experiment C (to use for generator) - Nil
generator: run experiment with model weights from experiment C and get result file in correct format - Xander

(optimization of generator and evaluator (perplexity?)
(make sure we are not missing anything...)
